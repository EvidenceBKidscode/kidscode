# Generate MD5 signatures for Lua files

The "md5.sh" shell script in the "adel/util/md5/" allows to update the production database,
by generating an SQL script file with the required commands.

It will scan all Lua files in the current folder and generate SQL commands like this one :

	update maps 
		set mods_hash_md5 = "c50f510b0072cb9467e0d4c43f96fcae" 
		where url_download = "http://assets.kidscode.com/master/test/x.lua";
