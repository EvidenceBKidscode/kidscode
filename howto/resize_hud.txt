# Resize HUD

The size and offset of the HUD bar, images and texts are automatically scaled proportionally to the window width.
 
The hud scaling factor is influence by the "hud_scaling" factor and the "hud_grid_resolution" divisor global settings : 

	hud_scaling = 1.0
	hud_grid_resolution = 1920.0
	
Small screen devices can use a lower hud grid resolution, like 960.0.
