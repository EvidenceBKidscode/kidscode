# Enable the mouse dampening for the 3D camera orientation

Start the kidscode client :

	Settings > Advanced Settings > Controls
	
		Mouse dampening influence : 1.0
		
			The mouse dampening is disabled if the influence is 0.
			
			Lower values make the dampening slower, thus softer.
			Higher values make the dampening faster, thus harder.
		
		Mouse dampening speed : 200.0

			If the mouse speed is less than this amount of pixels per second (on a normalized 1000-pixels wide screen),
			it quickly slows down until it stops.
