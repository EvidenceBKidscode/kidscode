# If enabled, there should be biome-specific tree, leaves and ground nodes. If disabled, stuff should use fallback nodes (like stone instead of desert stone).

# Many mapgen aliases have fallback values when no value is provided. Having this setting disabled can be useful to test whether those fallback values are functional.
