------------------------------
REFI_Textures:
------------------------------

Textures created from scratch in an attempt to recapture the aesthetic of Minecraft.
This version is usable in both Minetest Game v5.x and MineClone2.

------------------------------


The 'textures' sub-folder now holds the supported textures for Minetest Game, and MineClone2.
It may be sub-divided further in the future, but for now you can easily move the textures back to the parent folder if you require support for Minetest 0.4.17.


**Also included in this package is the following:**
*	Partial support for the game, SkyFactory. 
*	Partial support for the mods used by mcimport in converted worlds.
*	Some templates for character skin creation.
*	Support for a few Minetest Game mods(currently: 3d_armor, bees, caverealms, hbhunger, mobs_redo, shop, simple_robots, stamina, thirsty)
